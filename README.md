Just practicing JS :)

# Starting the project

To start this project first you need Docker and Docker Compose installed on your O.S.
Here you can find the link for both of them:
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

After installing them just run `docker-compose up` and everything should run correctly.
